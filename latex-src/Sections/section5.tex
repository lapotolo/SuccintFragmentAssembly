\section{Simulating the overlap graph}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Link between variable-order and overlaps.}

Overlaps between R∗ can be comreads inputed using VO-BOSS(G′) as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item extend a unary path using solid nodes as much as
	possible, 
	
	\item if a solid node v without outgoing edges is reached, then decrease its order with shorter to retrieve the vo-dBG nodes that represent both a suffix of v and a prefix of some read in R.
	From these nodes, retrieve the overlapping solid nodes of v by using forward and
	continue the graph right traversal from one of them.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Problem with shorter operation}
In VO-BOSS, however, shorter does not ensure that the label of the output node appears
as a prefix in R∗
. The next lemma precises the condition that must hold to ensure this.
